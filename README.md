## Project Description:

The proposed outcome of this project is Traveler Matchup application that allows users to be matched with possible housing accomodations for their trip, as well as matching them up with locals who are eager to hangout and who speak your language.  The application captures the user's information when completing a form, and then uses algorithms to match the user with a possible accomodation and possible local friend, based on the user's answers to the form.

### Technologies/Languages used:

- HTML, CSS, Favicon, Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap4's New Features: CARDS, Google Web Fonts, Javascript, jQuery, Popper.js, Animated SVG, Google Places API Autocomplete - Geolocate, JSON, Package.JSON, Node.js, Express, Body-Parser, Express-Handlebars, MySQL Database, Sequelize ORM, Nodemon, MVC Paradigm folder structure, GET and POST routes.
